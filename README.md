# Forums System

this is a pretty basic forums system I built with php, html, mysql etc.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

you'll need to install [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) and then active Apache and MySQL

### Installing

After you did the above, open your web browser and open 

```
http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
```
go to import in the menu at the of the page click on choose a file and import the file [forum.sql](forum.sql) and hit go at the bottom of the page,
then move all the other project files to xampp/htdocs probably under C driver and then you're good to go! just type
```
http://localhost/forum/users/
```
and you'll have a completely new forums website
